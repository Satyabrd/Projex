Techstack:
==========================
React, vite, fastapi, python, postgresql

Next: next can be used but assignment was mentioned in pure react , so SSR didn't use.

Pending works:
========================
A lot of integration work is pending because of less time

Fallback:
==========================
If we don't connect to postgresql db, then there's a json file from where data ll be loaded

![Project Inventory Page](./demo-pages/Inventory_page.png)

![Project Creation Modal](./demo-pages/Add_project_modal.png)

![Project Details Page](./demo-pages/Project_details_page.png)

![Project Deletion Modal](./demo-pages/Project_Deletion_modal.png)

Back button works as expected, it moves data to history page.
